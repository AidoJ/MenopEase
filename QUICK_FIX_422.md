# Quick Fix for 422 Error

## The Problem
You're getting a 422 error when trying to sign in. This usually means one of these:

## Most Common Fix: Create User via Supabase Dashboard

Since signup might not be working, let's create a user directly:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Authentication** → **Users**
3. Click **"Add user"** → **"Create new user"**
4. Fill in:
   - **Email**: `test@example.com` (or any email)
   - **Password**: `test123456` (at least 6 characters)
   - **Auto Confirm User**: ✅ **CHECK THIS BOX** (very important!)
5. Click **"Create user"**

## Then Try Logging In

1. Go to your login page
2. Use the **exact** email and password you just created
3. Try to sign in

## If That Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Is Email Confirmed?
1. Go to **Supabase** → **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Find your user
3. Check if there's a green checkmark next to "Email confirmed"
4. If NOT:
   - Click on the user
   - Look for "Confirm email" or similar option
   - Or go to **Settings** and disable email confirmation

### Check 2: Supabase Settings
1. **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Scroll to **"Email Auth"**
3. Make sure **"Enable email confirmations"** is **OFF**
4. Click **Save**

### Check 3: Check Browser Console
After my code update, you should see detailed logs. Look for:
- "Login attempt starting..."
- "Login response:..."
- "Login error object:..."

**What error message do you see in the console?**

### Check 4: Network Tab
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. **Network** tab
3. Try to sign in
4. Find the `/auth/v1/token` request
5. Click it → **Response** tab
6. **What does it say?**

## Alternative: Try Sign Up Instead

If login doesn't work, try signing up:
1. Go to `/signup` page
2. Enter email and password
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. Check Supabase → Authentication → Users to see if user was created
5. Then try logging in

## Still Not Working?

Please share:
1. **What you see in browser console** (all the log messages)
2. **What the Network tab Response says** (the actual error message)
3. **Whether the user shows as "Email confirmed"** in Supabase

This will help me pinpoint the exact issue!
