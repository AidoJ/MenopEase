# Verify You're Using the Correct Supabase Project

## The Issue
Your database is named "menopEase" but that shouldn't matter. However, you need to make sure your Netlify environment variables are pointing to the **correct Supabase project**.

## Step 1: Verify Your Supabase Project

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Check your **project name** - is it "menopEase" or something else?
3. Look at the **Project URL** in the top left or Settings → API
4. It should be something like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`

## Step 2: Check Netlify Environment Variables

1. Go to **Netlify Dashboard**
2. Your site → **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
3. Check `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`:
   - Should match your Supabase project URL exactly
   - Should be: `https://ttqvefkilgitjzcewfgq.supabase.co` (based on your error)
4. Check `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`:
   - Should be the anon key from the SAME project

## Step 3: Get the Correct Credentials

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** for your "menopEase" project
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon) → **API**
3. Copy:
   - **Project URL** → This goes in `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public** key → This goes in `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Step 4: Update Netlify

1. Go to **Netlify** → Your site → **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Update `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` with the correct URL
3. Update `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with the correct key
4. **Save**

## Step 5: Trigger New Deploy

1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Clear cache and deploy site**
3. Wait for build to complete
4. Try again

## Important Notes

- **Database name doesn't matter** - "menopEase" vs "MenoTrak" is fine
- **Project URL must match** - The URL in Netlify must match your Supabase project
- **Anon key must match** - Must be from the same project as the URL
- **Both must be from the same project** - Can't mix credentials from different projects

## Quick Check

Your error shows: `ttqvefkilgitjzcewfgq.supabase.co`

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Check if your project URL matches: `https://ttqvefkilgitjzcewfgq.supabase.co`
3. If it does, you're using the right project
4. If it doesn't, you need to update Netlify with the correct URL

## Still Getting Errors?

After updating and redeploying, check:
1. Browser console - do you see "✅ Supabase client initialized"?
2. Or do you see "❌ Supabase client NOT properly configured!"?

This will tell us if the environment variables are being read correctly.
